###MINI_Zma_2023.1_motifMappings
#gff3: NAM v5.0 (obtained from Plaza Monocots 5). Filtered for protein coding genes and longest splicing variant.
#genome version: NAM v5.0  (obtained from Plaza Monocots 5).
#promoter definition: 5000kb upstream the translation starting site, 1000kb downstream the translation ending site. Introns were included in the regulatory regions, while coding exons were excluded. 
#mapping parameters ensemble: top 8000 Cluster Buster matches, top 16000 FIMO matches. Introns were included in the regulatory regions, while coding exons were excluded. 
#motif database version: motifs starting with "MA" are from JASPAR2022 (Castro-Mondragon, Riudavets-Puig, Rauluseviciute, et al. , PMID:34850907), motifs starting with "M0" or "M1" are from CisBP2.00 (updated, Weirauch et al., 2014, PMID:25215497).
##GO annotation(MINI-AC): downloaded from PLAZA Monocots 5 (https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/plaza/versions/plaza_v5_monocots/) (Van Bel et al. 2022). Evidence codes IBA, IC, IDA, IEA, IEP, IGI, IMP, IPI, ISO, ISS, NAS, ND, RCA and TAS. GO annotation files were extended for parental terms and filtered for GO terms that were associated with less than 1000 genes (discarding very general GO terms), and for GO terms of the category “Biological Process” (BP).

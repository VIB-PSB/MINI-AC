#gff3: Araport11 (obtained from Plaza Dicots 4.5). Filtered for protein coding genes and longest splicing variant.
#genome version: Araport11  (obtained from Plaza Dicots 4.5).
#promoter definition: 5000kb upstream the translation starting site, 1000kb downstream the translation ending site. Introns were included in the regulatory regions, while coding exons were excluded. 
#mapping parameters ensemble: top 4000 Cluster Buster matches, top 7000 FIMO matches.
#motif database version: motifs starting with "MA" are from JASPAR2020 (Fornes et al., 2020, PMID:31701148), motifs starting with "M0" or "M1" are from CisBP2.00 (updated, Weirauch et al., 2014, PMID:25215497), others are from TF2Network (Kulkarni et al., 2018, PMID:29272447).
#GO annotation (MINI-AC): downloaded onJuly 2021 from http://geneontology.org/gene-associations/tair.gaf.gz. Filtered for GO annotations of type “full”, and evidence types “experimental” and “author/curator statement” (evidence codes: EXP, IMP, IDA, IPI, IGI, IEP, TAS, NAS, and IC). GO annotation files were extended for parental terms and filtered for GO terms of the category “Biological Process” (BP)

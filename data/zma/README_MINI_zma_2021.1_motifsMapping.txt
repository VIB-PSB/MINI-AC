#gff3: AGP v4.0 (obtained from Plaza Monocots 4.5). Filtered for protein coding genes and longest splicing variant.
#genome version: AGP v4.0  (obtained from Plaza Monocots 4.5).
#promoter definition: 5000kb upstream the translation starting site, 1000kb downstream the translation ending site. Introns were included in the regulatory regions, while coding exons were excluded. 
#mapping parameters ensemble: top 8000 Cluster Buster matches, top 16000 FIMO matches. Introns were included in the regulatory regions, while coding exons were excluded. 
#motif database version: motifs starting with "MA" are from JASPAR2020 (Fornes et al., 2020, PMID:31701148), motifs starting with "M0" or "M1" are from CisBP2.00 (updated, Weirauch et al., 2014, PMID:25215497).
##GO annotation(MINI-AC): downloaded from PLAZA Dicots 4.5 (https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/plaza/versions/plaza_v4_5_dicots/) (Van Bel et al. 2018). GO annotation files were extended for parental terms and filtered for GO terms that were associated with less than 1000 genes (discarding very general GO terms), and for GO terms of the category “Biological Process” (BP).
